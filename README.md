[base32cx](https://word.site/2019/11/13/base32cx/) (pronounced "base 32 checks" shortened to `b32x`) is a base32 encoding with letter-case checksum. Don't say "base32x", because that's a homophone for "base32hex".

This is the first implementation. It is not efficient and the canonical tests need to be verified. Please consider making your own implementation.
